# RDPWraper
Easy and automatic termsrv.dll patcher for Windows 10 1909 version 18363.959 - with updated ini file. To install make a "RDP Wrapper" directory in Program Files, Copy all those files inside then disconnect internet and in Command Prompt window execute "RDPWinst.exe -i"

### The goal of this project is to enable Remote Desktop Host support and concurrent RDP sessions on reduced functionality systems for home usage.

RDP Wrapper works as a layer between Service Control Manager and Terminal Services, so the original termsrv.dll file remains untouched. Also this method is very strong against Windows Update.
